# Clientele.js (DEFUNCT)

Clientele.js was going to be an OpenAPI codegen ecosystem targeting TypeScript and JavaScript, inspired by Octokit. Its main focus was extensibility, so that it would be easy to build additional functionality by using Clientele.js and its plugins as a base.

However, better solutions for this are already available. This exists merely as an archive.
